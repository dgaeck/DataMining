The data includes 569 examples of cancer biopsies, each with 32 features. The first feature is an ID number, the second is the cancer diagnosis, and they are followed by 30 numeric-valued lab measurements. The diagnosis is coded as “M” to indicate malignant, or “B” to indicate benign. Measurements comprise the mean, standard error, and worst (ie largest) value for 10 different characteristics of the digitized cell nuclei. The features relate to the shape and size of the cell nuclei.\n",
